    - During my stay at the college, I learnt tons of new things, related to both academics and co-curricular activities.
    - The course framework was quite broad and touched upon most of the things required for an overall developement as 
    a computer science engineer.
    - Talking about the co-curricular activities, two of the most interesting things I learnt during my stay at the university are
