    - During my stay at the college, I learn't a ton of new things, both related to academics and co-curricular.
    - The course framework was quite broad and touched upon most of the things required for a overall developement as 
    a computer science engineer.
    - Taking about the co-curricular activities, the two things I admire the most which I learn't here are- BasketBall and Photography.
