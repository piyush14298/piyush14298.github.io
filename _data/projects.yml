    Homomorphic encryption for training Neural Networks
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - This project was part of Cryptography Course at university.
    - Taking advantage of the property of homomorphic encryption scheme of allowing arithmetic operation over encrypted text,
    me along with a classmate developed a neural network which could be trained over encrypted data.
    - This is a step towards a private and secure future considering that the future is AI based.
    - Used Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption system proposed by [Zhou and Wornell](https://www.rle.mit.edu/sia/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2014-zhou-wornell-ita.pdf).

    An Assistant for Researchers
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - This tool helps researchers to find research papers on topic which they are working on.
    - The researcher provides a link to a sample research paper (pdf) and then this tool parse the text from 
    pdf to create a query which is used to crawl the internet.
    - This tool uses focused crawling which helped reduce search time and improved efficiency.
    - As this tool crawls the internet to search for research papers so it can only find openly accessible research papers.
    - Implemented using Python and its libraries like <mark>BeautifulSoup</mark> ,<mark>NLTK</mark> , 
    <mark>request</mark> , <mark>PyPDF</mark>.

    Smart India Hackathon Finals
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - As a part of Smart India Hackathon, built an engine that would crawl the surface web,
    search for child abuse, women abuse, cyber bullying and pornography and would
    report the same to the authorities. 
    - The implementation included use of <mark>Information
    retrieval</mark>, <mark>Machine learning</mark> and <mark>Natural language processing</mark>.

    Developed a novel idea for waste segreagation and management
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - Worked on developing an idea for making waste segregation and collection easy and fruitful using blockchain. 
    - The idea was developed by me and my team mates during an academic course. 
    - Considering the novelty of the idea, 
    a patent was filed for the same which is currently under evaluation.

    Security Analysis of Cloud-IoT based environment for HealthCare services
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The project dealt with security analysis of cloud-IoT based environment which has potential applications 
    in health care services of the future. It mainly dealt with creating a new protocol for transmission of user's 
    data over the insecure internet by analysing the present proposed protocols and improving them to obtain a lightweight 
    but effective protocol. In the process I learned <mark>HLPSL</mark> (High Level Protocol Specification Language) and 
    <mark>AVISPA</mark> tool for testing new protocols.
