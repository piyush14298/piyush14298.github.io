    **QBox**

    QBox is a secure file-sharing service. It is a customized version of the popularly available VSFTPD server.
    
    Learnt the following things on the go:
    - Created pre-install scripts to run system checks, install and configure QBox.
    - Developed tools to automatically analyze performance and functionality issues in different versions of QBox.

    Skills Learnt: 
    <mark>Linux Commands</mark>
    <mark>OS Concepts</mark>
    <mark>Networking Concepts</mark>
    <mark>Network Security</mark>



    **QMoney**

    QMoney is a visual stock portfolio analyzer. It helps portfolio managers make trade recommendations for their clients.
    
    Learnt the following things on the go:
    - Implemented the core logic of the portfolio manager and published it as a library.
    - Refactored code to add support for multiple stock quote services.
    - Improved application stability and performance.

    Skills Learnt: 
    <mark>Java</mark>
    <mark>REST API</mark>
    <mark>Jackson</mark>
    <mark>Interfaces</mark>
    <mark>Code Refactoring</mark>
    <mark>Gradle</mark>



    **QCharm**

    QCharm is an online IDE. Programmers use QCharm to write source code and execute it inside the editor.
    
    Learnt the following things on the go:
    - Implemented basic editor features that included: opening a file, navigation, search/replace, cut/copy/paste, undo/redo.
    - Implemented the same functionality with multiple data structures to understand the effect of design choices on performance.
    - Improved the performance further by using hybrid data structures and algorithms.

    Skills Learnt: 
    <mark>Applied DS</mark>
    <mark>ArrayList</mark>
    <mark>Naive Search</mark>
    <mark>String manipulation</mark>
    <mark>KMP search</mark>

    Homomorphic encryption for training Neural Networks
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - This project was part of Cryptography Course at university.
    - Taking advantage of the property of homomorphic encryption scheme of allowing arithmetic operation over encrypted text,
    me along with a classmate developed a neural network which could be trained over encrypted data.
    - This is a step towards a private and secure future considering that the future is AI based.
    - Used Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption system proposed by [Zhou and Wornell](https://www.rle.mit.edu/sia/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2014-zhou-wornell-ita.pdf).

    An Assistant for Researchers
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - This tool helps researchers to find research papers on topic which they are working on.
    - The researcher provides a link to a sample research paper (pdf) and then this tool parse the text from 
    pdf to create a query which is used to crawl the internet.
    - This tool uses focused crawling which helped reduce search time and improved efficiency.
    - As this tool crawls the internet to search for research papers so it can only find openly accessible research papers.
    - Implemented using Python and its libraries like <mark>BeautifulSoup</mark> ,<mark>NLTK</mark> , 
    <mark>request</mark> , <mark>PyPDF</mark>.
