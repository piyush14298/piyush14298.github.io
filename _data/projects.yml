#     Major takeaways:
#     - Created pre-installed scripts to run system checks, install and configure QBox.
#     - Developed tools to automatically analyze performance and functionality issues in different versions of QBox.

#     Skills Learnt: 
#     <mark>Linux Commands</mark>
#     <mark>OS Concepts</mark>
#     <mark>Networking Concepts</mark>
#     <mark>Network Security</mark>



#     **QMoney**

#     QMoney is a visual stock portfolio analyzer. It helps portfolio managers make trade recommendations for their clients.
    
#     Major takeaways:
#     - Implemented the core logic of the portfolio manager and published it as a library.
#     - Refactored code to add support for multiple stock quote services.
#     - Improved application stability and performance.

#     Skills Learnt:

   COVID-19 risk assesment and predictor tool
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - Developed an COVID-19 risk assessment tool and COVID-19 predictor tool based on Chest X-Rays.
    - There were two parts: Risk assessment, Chest X-Ray analysis
      - Risk assesment was based on dataset by Nexiod and we tested and compared multiple ML models after data preprocessing
      - Covid Predictor was built using deep learning models trained using transfer learning and also tried a model built from scratch
      - We achieved around 98% accuracy in predicting COVID-19 from Chest X-Rays.
    - Deployed these models using Django framework, Python, HTML, CSS.

    Homomorphic encryption for training Neural Networks
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - This project was a part of Cryptography Course at the university.
    - Taking advantage of the property of homomorphic encryption scheme of allowing arithmetic operation over encrypted text,
    I along with a classmate developed a neural network which could be trained over encrypted data.
    - This is a step towards a private and secure future considering that the future is AI based.
    - Used Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption system proposed by [Zhou and Wornell](https://www.rle.mit.edu/sia/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2014-zhou-wornell-ita.pdf).

    An Assistant for Researchers
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - This tool helps researchers to find research papers on the topics which they are working on.
    - The researcher provides a link to a sample research paper (pdf) and then this tool parses the text from 
    pdf to create a query which is used to crawl the internet.
    - This tool uses focused crawling which helps reduce search time and improves efficiency.
    - As this tool crawls the internet to search for research papers so it can only find openly accessible research papers.
    - Implemented using Python and its libraries like <mark>BeautifulSoup</mark> ,<mark>NLTK</mark> , 
    <mark>request</mark> , <mark>PyPDF</mark>.

    Smart India Hackathon Finals
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - As a part of Smart India Hackathon, built an engine that would crawl the surface web,
    search for child abuse, women abuse, cyber bullying and pornography and would
    report the same to the authorities. 
    - The implementation included use of <mark>Information
    retrieval</mark>, <mark>Machine learning</mark> and <mark>Natural language processing</mark>.

    Security Analysis of Cloud-IoT based environment for HealthCare services
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The project dealt with security analysis of cloud-IoT based environment which has potential applications 
    in health care services of the future. It mainly dealt with creating a new protocol for transmission of user's 
    data over the insecure internet by analysing the present proposed protocols and improving them to obtain a lightweight 
    but effective protocol. In the process I learnt <mark>HLPSL</mark> (High Level Protocol Specification Language) and 
    <mark>AVISPA</mark> tool for testing new protocols.
