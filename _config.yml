  Hi, my name is Piyush. I am a student at BML Munjal University. I am a passionate coder and have experience in Algorithms, 
  Data Structures, backend developement, web developement, etc. As a natural born go-getter, my passion has continuously driven 
  me to expand my knowledge, experience, and relationships. With a strong background and diverse skill set, Iâ€™m confident in 
  the creative ideas and successful solutions I bring to the table. Keep exploring my site to learn more information about me.

  I have worked with many languages, frameworks and technologies like <mark>C++</mark>, <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>
  , <mark>REST APIs</mark>, <mark>Vue</mark>, <mark>MySQL</mark>, <mark>git</mark>, etc.

  Currently I am looking forward to opportunities which allow me to apply my problem solving and logical thinking abilities 
  to the real world scenarios and solve real world problems.

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
